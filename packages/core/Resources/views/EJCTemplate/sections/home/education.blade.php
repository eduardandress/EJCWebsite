                <h3>Algorithm principles - C & C++ development</h3>
                <p>This was the beginning of the journey. We started getting our minds completely changed, a new way of thinking, understanding the Abstraction concept and the importance of it not just for good programming but common problem solving.

                <p>We learned how to code in C, applying all the theoretical concepts. We learned data structures and all the language elements. Then we used C++ which gave us a flavor about Object-oriented programming (OOP).</p>
              </li>
              <li class="event" >
                <h3>Database principles & Software engineering</h3>
                <p>
                 We started learning all the process required to design and create safe and efficient databases, from creating E-R diagrams to query optimizations and advanced techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, we studied all the principles applied to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software in a systematic method. We studied and used software development methodologies and frameworks like Agile Software Development, Extreme Programming (XP), Rapid Application Development (RAD), Scrum, RUP, and others.
                </p>
              </li>

                <h3>Web application development & Web frameworks </h3>
                <p>
                  Here we learned all about web development principles and methodologies. We started designing and creating not just simple 'Web sites' but complete applications using PHP language as back-end and front-end languages and like Javascript(Vanilla) and the very known JS Framework: Jquery. And of course HTML & CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As long as we started to realize how complexed a real web application could end up being, we learned the importance of a good project structure and the advantages of using web frameworks. We learned a lot about them, how to use them, when and when not to use them, etc. Also, we applied architectural patterns like REST and SOAP which provide scalability to the apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                 And then Symfony came along. Our first web framework, one of the most used and powerful PHP frameworks... and with a very steep learning curve. We experimented with it by developing several apps, and it was tremendously awesome, haha.

                <h3>Networks Fundamentals & Computer Graphics</h3>
                <p>
                 Well... we learned the building blocks of modern network design. Essentially, we learned about the many different types of networks, networking concepts, network architecture, network communications and network design.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you know how they make all these Disney movies, animations and video games? Using Computer Graphics! well... we didn't make 'Finding nemo' or something like that... but we learned the basics of graphic computing and programmed some 2D and 3D images :D.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="event" >
                <h3>Mobile development & HCI </h3>
                <p>
                  Well guys, at this point we already had the enough knowledge and some expertise in programming (we already knew all the principles of programming languages), so we started developing mobile applications for Android using JAVA. We learned and used Cloud Computing technologies and techniques to make robust and scalable apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To complete the circle, we learned about HCI (Human-computer interaction) which involves how users interact with any device and its software, all the cognitive process carried out. Finally, we learned about UX (User experience) and how to make good interfaces (UI).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="event" >
                <h3>Computer Systems Performance Evaluation </h3>
                <p>
                  Here we learned all about how to measure and optimize the performance of an IT architecture. Learned how to identify and solve bottlenecks in any IT component, capacity management. In a nutshell: all the ITSM (IT Service Management) lifecycle stages using its 'bible' ITIL.
